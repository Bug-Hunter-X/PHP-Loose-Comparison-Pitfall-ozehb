In PHP, a common yet easily overlooked error involves the usage of the `==` (loose comparison) operator instead of the `===` (strict comparison) operator.  This often leads to unexpected results when comparing values of different types. For example, comparing 0 to 'abc' with `==` yields true because PHP's loose comparison converts the string to an integer 0 before comparison, while `===` would correctly return false because the types differ.
