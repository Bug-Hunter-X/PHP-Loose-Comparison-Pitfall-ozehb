This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming involving loose comparisons. The `looseComparisonBug.php` file shows the problematic code using `==`, and `looseComparisonSolution.php` provides the corrected version using `===` for type-safe comparisons.  Using strict comparison (`===`) prevents unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types and makes your code more robust.
